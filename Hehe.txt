Timetravel?
So we are how far into the future???
Ok that was only one day, let's try a few years maybe?
Ok how far can we go???
So does git only use a 32 bit signed integer for unix time?
Wait
Ok back in time we go :>
So is this the limit?
Or is this the limit?
I am going further and further I see :>
Now maybe this is the last date possible?
Did we hit the year 2100?
One more day
